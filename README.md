# mashup CS50/pset8

Mashup is a website that lets users search for articles atop a map 
(US map, particularly).

For this task I had to find out how to load files (US.txt) in SQLite database, 
met with simple Javascript, JSON, Ajax, JQuery 
and how to mashup different API together (Google Maps and Google News).

I had some disrtibution code and static files but I had to implement the following:
- mashup.db;
- /articles in application.py;
- /search in application.py;
- addMarker in script.js;
- removeMarkers in script.js.
